## Survey: India - Household Consumer Expenditure, NSS 75th Round Sch1.0 Type 2 : 2017-2018, MMRP
**3.1 Reference Period**: NSS 75th round survey on Household Consumer Expenditure used only **Modified Mixed Reference Period** (MMRP, described in details in paragraph 2.3.1 of chapter 2) as adopted in NSS 68th round.   
In 66th and 68th round survey, three different methods of measurement of Monthly Per Capita Expenditure (MPCE) at the household level â€“ the URP (Uniform Reference Period), MRP (Mixed Reference Period) and MMRP (Modified Mixed Reference Period) were used.      

In this chapter, which gives summary results, the estimates are based on MMRP method for the 75th round. It is to be noted that, the MMRP method uses the reference periods that were recommended after suitable experimentation by the Expert Group on Non-Sampling Errors.     

Since, MMRP estimates are available only from the 66th round onwards, discussion of change in consumption over time has been restricted over 66th (2009-10), 68th (2011-12) and 75th (2017-18) rounds.
